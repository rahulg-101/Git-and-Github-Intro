## GITHUB  
Website that allows developers to store and manage their code using GIT.We upload the project in folders called Repositories(or Repo) on github. Also you can watch other people's repo's,clone and download it etc.

### Step 1 - Create Repo

You will see a readme.md file once a repo is created

**Readme** file is stored as Readme.md where `".md"` stands for `markdown`, there is a message against the README.md file on slight right, upon initial setting up of repo, this will always contain the message `"initial commit"`

You can go on the edit option, do some editing and select commit changes. You may additionally add a message while doing this change which will reflect on the repo as well
